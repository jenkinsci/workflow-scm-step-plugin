<div>
    Loads a (text) file from an SCM repository and returns the contents.
    Unlike <code>readFile</code> this does not require a local checkout or even an agent.
    Unlike <code>readTrusted</code> this does not presume anything about where the Pipeline script came from
    and does not check whether a trusted user committed changes to the file.
